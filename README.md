## Running Locally

### Pre environment
1. **Node**: Check that both your development environment and deployment environment are using `Node v18` or later. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple `node` versions locallyã€‚
   ```bash
    node -v
   ```
2. **PNPM**: We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies. If you have never installed pnpm, you can install it with the following command:
   ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
   ```
3. **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Before running this application, you need to obtain the API key from Anthropic. 

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
    pnpm install
   ```
2. Copy the `.env.example` file, then rename it to `.env`, and add your [Anthropic API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the `.env` file.
   ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxx...
   ```
3. Run the application, the local project runs on `http://localhost:3000/`
   ```bash
    pnpm run dev
   ```
